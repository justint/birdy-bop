This is the Unity project repository - to contribute, make a new directory under your "Unity Projects" directory (`C:/Users/Public/Public Documents/Unity Projects` for me) and make a pull request there.

As of right now (Jan 30, 12:00AM), we're building on the Android platform, so if you wish to build + run make sure your SDK + NDK settings are configured correctly. Check out [this tutorial](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/live-training-archive/mobile-development) on the basics, check in with @octop1 for any help on this.

Builds (*.apks) that are for testing/not release versions should be titled `<version name/number>-develop.apk`.
